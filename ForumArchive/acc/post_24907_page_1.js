There is no exporter for c4d So I have to export my meshes as OBJ-files. These are not smoothed but only flat shaded within babylon. Unfortunately Babylon is not able to load other file formats like FBX_co_ DAE (Collada). That is a very big thing for me. I don_t_t want to use any other 3D-tool like blender or 3ds-max just to convert my meshes into the babylon fileformat. Three is able to load collaa-files so I can directly use my meshes from c4d in Three.

Development-speed_dd_ The reason why I changed to babylon was that I read that the babylon framework was created of some guys of microsoft. So I thought that there is a (big) team that is well payed to develop that technology very fast and professional. It is developed professional (except the docu _dd_-)) but for me it looks like _lt_a contenteditable_eq__qt_false_qt_ data-ipshover_eq__qt__qt_ data-ipshover-target_eq__qt_http_dd_//www.html5gamedevs.com/profile/4442-deltakosh/?do_eq_hovercard_qt_ data-mentionid_eq__qt_4442_qt_ href_eq__qt_http_dd_//www.html5gamedevs.com/profile/4442-deltakosh/_qt_ rel_eq__qt__qt__gt_@Deltakosh_lt_/a_gt_ is a main developer and some other community-members like _lt_a contenteditable_eq__qt_false_qt_ data-ipshover_eq__qt__qt_ data-ipshover-target_eq__qt_http_dd_//www.html5gamedevs.com/profile/10310-raananw/?do_eq_hovercard_qt_ data-mentionid_eq__qt_10310_qt_ href_eq__qt_http_dd_//www.html5gamedevs.com/profile/10310-raananw/_qt_ rel_eq__qt__qt__gt_@RaananW_lt_/a_gt_ are doing further developments. I_t_m sorry to say that but I thnik that even Three is sometime a step ahead. So there I can already use THC Vive controllers. And then there is suddenly a framework _lt_a href_eq__qt_https_dd_//aframe.io/_qt_ rel_eq__qt_external nofollow_qt__gt_https_dd_//aframe.io/_lt_/a_gt_ that is also great and easy to use.

I think I have to reply because otherwise my descion seems to be misunderstood. As I said (and I can_t_t repeat it often enough)_dd_ I have very big respect for all your work done to create such a great framework!!! Only because of the work of so talented guys like you_co_ people like me can use this technology. The framework is very great and we all know that. Also the community and the playground are things that I won_t_t find at Three or at a-frame.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tBut there is one thing that I would like to clear at this point_dd_ I don_t_t want to feel sorry that I use Babylon without developing on it. I absolutely understand that you all built that thing upmin your free time just because you WANT it to build. For me it sounds like I_t_m not worth using babylon when I don_t_t want to invest my free time to develop on it. This is not fair in my opinion.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tMy question was just if I have to change the framework to achieve special results like getting HTC Vive controllers or if you would say that it_t_s also usable in Babylon. I don_t_t know how to develop a plugin that recognized the data of the controllers (yet)_co_ and due to small timings_co_ I had to find a solution for my customer. And even it sounds hard now_dd_ with a-frame I had build up a complete project within one day and I am sure that it would have taken several days longer by trying to develop the solution by myself. a-frame is nothing more than a framework based on Three_co_ so it_t_s not _t_better than Three or even Babylon. In my case it just was faster to use and it just had features that I currently needed. The forum is really great and I know that many of you guys answer very quick and also very friendly. I like it a lot_co_ but when it gets to a small deadline I have to look for ready-to-use technologies instead of asking for solutions. Please note that I really don_t_t want to harm anybody here. I just try to explain why I had to descide myself. \n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tI also told about other problems that I have with Babylon and you already gave nice answers to that! Thanks a lot for it!\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tSo here_t_s my current thoughts_dd_ I HAVE TO use another framework due to the given timings of my customer. As I said I_t_m sure that it won_t_t take long that I use Babylon again. And when I find free time_co_ I really will try to develop something for the framework so that I don_t_t have to feel bad anymore to use it _dd_-)\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t_lt_/div_gt_\n\n\t\t_lt_div class_eq__qt_ipsI_qt__gt__lt_/div_gt__lt_/div_gt_"},{"Owner":"JCPalmer","Date":"2016-09-02T18:07:25Z","Content":"_lt_div class_eq__qt_mages_qt__gt_\n\t\t\t_lt_p_gt_\n\t_lt_a contenteditable_eq__qt_false_qt_ data-ipshover_eq__qt__qt_ data-ipshover-target_eq__qt_http_dd_//www.html5gamedevs.com/profile/21403-jellix/?do_eq_hovercard_qt_ data-mentionid_eq__qt_21403_qt_ href_eq__qt_http_dd_//www.html5gamedevs.com/profile/21403-jellix/_qt_ rel_eq__qt__qt__gt_@jellix_lt_/a_gt__co_ stop digging.  Now you know not to title a topic like that again.  Stick to asking questions.  Anything remotely close to repercussions for the lack of a _qt_feature_qt_ is sure to backfire.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t_lt_/div_gt_\n\n\t\t_lt_div class_eq__qt_ipsI_qt__gt__lt_/div_gt__lt_/div_gt_"},{"Owner":"Wingnut","Date":"2016-09-02T21:28:31Z","Content":"_lt_div class_eq__qt_mages_qt__gt_\n\t\t\t\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tI didn_t_t see any digging.  I saw clarification.  I think Jellix is simply explaining why the situation is so urgent... and is trying to see if there are some quick solutions.  Time is not on the side of Jellix.  Jellix_co_ you need to _lt_u_gt_try_lt_/u_gt_ to _qt_loosen_qt_ your deadlines a bit_co_ though.  You_t_re going to have a heart attack.  _lt_img alt_eq__qt__dd_o_qt_ data-emoticon_eq__qt__qt_ height_eq__qt_20_qt_ src_eq__qt_http_dd_//www.html5gamedevs.com/uploads/emoticons/default_ohmy.png_qt_ srcset_eq__qt_http_dd_//www.html5gamedevs.com/uploads/emoticons/ohmy@2x.png 2x_qt_ title_eq__qt__dd_o_qt_ width_eq__qt_20_qt_ /_gt__lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tYou are dealing with leading edge tech_co_ trying to make it cross-browser and cross-platform.  These clients of yours... need to get a grasp.   It is always difficult to get a sure-aim on something that is moving at 100 kph/mph.  _lt_img alt_eq__qt__dd_)_qt_ data-emoticon_eq__qt__qt_ height_eq__qt_20_qt_ src_eq__qt_http_dd_//www.html5gamedevs.com/uploads/emoticons/default_smile.png_qt_ srcset_eq__qt_http_dd_//www.html5gamedevs.com/uploads/emoticons/smile@2x.png 2x_qt_ title_eq__qt__dd_)_qt_ width_eq__qt_20_qt_ /_gt_  Did you make some unattainable promises? \n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tSo_co_ I will suggest that Jellix use whatever he can get his hands-on... that works.  We_t_ll be here for your next project.  So will 3JS.  We_t_re all in this webGL thing together... all the frameworks_co_ all the brains_co_ all the tools.  We sure won_t_t delete your forum account just because you HAVE TO use another framework for certain projects.  You_t_ll always be welcome here_co_ and I can guarantee that folks here will be taking your concerns seriously and keeping them in their pockets... to possibly address sooner or later.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tWe_t_re small_co_ Jellix.  We have only a few core programmers and docs authors.  And guess what?   EACH of them is being hounded by deadlines_co_ too - personal_co_ corporate_co_ monetary_co_ you name it.

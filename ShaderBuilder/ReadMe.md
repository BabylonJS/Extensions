Anything in here is a solution for make easy way to solve a problem. So when we look shader parts (fragment and vertex) we see Low-level programming language and that is hard to programming in this language with other high-level language (javascript in this case).


why : shader is Low-level programming language.
what: define some structure and function to make easy and understandable.
who : all babylonjs users.
when : anytime we need a matrial or postprocess we can use that.
where : in Browsers can be support WebGl.

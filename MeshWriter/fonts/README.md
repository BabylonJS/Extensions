# So you want to build a 3-D font, eh?

3-D font conversion is now an automatic process.&nbsp;
The documentation further below is no longer needed (although you are welcome to read it).&nbsp;
Instead, go to https://github.com/briantbutton/meshwriter-font for a package that will convert full font files.&nbsp;
When you have done that, come back here for further instructions.


## Building MeshWriter with a customized font set

MeshWriter can build with an arbitrary selection of font files.&nbsp;
All font files should be converted into MeshWriter form and placed in this directory.&nbsp;
Linking the font files into your build is done with a require statement.&nbsp;
Easy.&nbsp;
Open /meshwriter/index.js and take a look at the steps described in the first fifty lines of that file.&nbsp;
Three steps for each font file.&nbsp;

### Step 1 - reference the font files into variable names

### Step 2 - call each font with 'codelist'

This just passes along the encoding function.&nbsp;
Sorry if it seems awkward.

### Step 3 - Assign a text name (or two) to each font

This is used to invoke it.


## Build a package

Make sure that you have loaded Earcut in npm &ndash; this is the only dependency.&nbsp;
On your dev machine (set up as described in meshwriter-font) go to the /meshwriter repo.&nbsp;
Type:

	npm run build

This has placed an unminified version of meshwriter, with all your fonts, in /meshwriter/dist.&nbsp;
Almost there!&nbsp;
It only remains to minify it.&nbsp;
Use any tool you want.  However, save "MeshWriter" as a reserved word.  Here is the command I use:

	terser meshwriter.js -m reserved=['MeshWriter'] --mangle-props regex=/^[xyw][Md][tia][nxh]/

We are now *finished*.&nbsp;
Back to our regularly scheduled programming, describing in detail how shapes are specified.&nbsp;

You may turn off your television sets now.&nbsp;

Stop reading.&nbsp;

## Background information:  How shapes are specified

### Basic shapes

Meshwriter curves follow SVG-style rules.  These include:&nbsp;   
  ~ 'M' move to, only at the beginning   
  ~ 'L' line, never at the beginning   
  ~ 'l' line   
  ~ 'Q' quadratic curve   
  ~ 'q' quadratic curve   
  ~ 'C' cubic curve   
  ~ 'c' cubic curve

Just below is an example from Comic (a gnarly font) showing the letter 'j' in SVG and in MeshWriter.&nbsp;
In MeshWriter, the commands are placed in arrays.&nbsp;
The length of the array indicates the command type.&nbsp;
  ~ 2: M or L   
  ~ 3: l   
  ~ 4: Q   
  ~ 5: q   
  ~ 6: C   
  ~ 7: c

**Key** **Point** Meshwriter shapes are superficially similar to SVG shapes but, instead of a parseable text string, commands are in arrays.&nbsp;
The size of the array indicates which command is specified.

Since 'j' has two shapes, including the dot, the fullPath shows two M commands.&nbsp;
In Meshwriter, this converted to two arrays, one for each shape.&nbsp;
So this means that shapeCmds has three levels.&nbsp;
At the top is an array containing all shapes, usually one or more.&nbsp;
Each shape is an array of commands, each command containing multiple coordinates.&nbsp;

	Three encodings for the letter 'j'

	shapeCmds : [[[233.5,632.5],[209.5,632.5,192,649.5],[175,666.5,175,690],[175,714,192,731],[209.5,748,233.5,748],[257.5,748,275,731],[292.5,714,292.5,690],[292.5,666.5,275,649.5],[257.5,632.5,233.5,632.5]],[[229.5,-116],[230,-57.5,212.5,183.5],[195.5,459],[195.5,484,209.5,503.5],[224,523,246,523],[263,523,280,510.5],[297,498,298,485],[314.5,197],[328,-111],[328,-180.5,286.5,-237],[241.5,-298.5,177,-298.5],[69.5,-298.5,-3,-133],[-9,-119.5,-9,-109],[-9,-89,6.5,-74.5],[22.5,-60,42.5,-60],[72,-60,104,-125],[112,-142,132,-174],[151.5,-199,177,-199],[199,-199,214.5,-166],[226.5,-141,229.5,-116]]],

The third version, sC is an encoded version, saving 45% of the space.&nbsp;
This may be handy should we want a lot of fonts in one package.&nbsp;
The encoding is proprietary, simple and built into MeshWriter.&nbsp;
It puts an array of arrays into an ASCII string.&nbsp;

Furthermore it is optional; any given symbol may present either shapeCmds or sC.&nbsp;
I usually encode stable symbols after a while.

### Acquiring the shapes

My approach has been to visit https://opentype.js.org/glyph-inspector.html, upload my font and then acquire glyphs in semi-SVG form.&nbsp; 

I have not been able to use the output of Glyph Inspector without review and, often, tuning.&nbsp;
More on that below.

### Holes

Many letters have holes in them.&nbsp;
Glyph Inspector also outputs the holes.&nbsp;
Meshwriter supports holes.&nbsp;
The basic task here is that fonts need not line up the hole to the shape it is coming from.&nbsp;
For MeshWriter, we must.&nbsp;
The '%', shown just below, is a classic example.

	Commands for Percent '%', with three shapes and two holes 
	shapeCmds : [
	  [[338,-24],[260,-24],[649,724],[725,724],[338,-24]],
	  [[751,-14],[665,-14,622,45],[584,96,584,185],[584,272,624,325],[668,384,751,384],[834,384,878,325],[918,272,918,185],[918,96,880,45],[837,-14,751,-14]],
	  [[249,316],[163,316,120,375],[82,426,82,515],[82,602,122,655],[166,714,249,714],[332,714,376,655],[416,602,416,515],[416,426,378,375],[335,316,249,316]]
	],
	holeCmds  : [
	  [],
	  [[[674,185],[674,51,750,51],[828,51,828,185],[828,319,750,319],[674,319,674,185]]],
	  [[[172,515],[172,381,248,381],[326,381,326,515],[326,649,248,649],[172,649,172,515]]]
	]

**Key** **Point** Hole commands are always one array level deeper than shape commands.&nbsp;
This is necessary because a single shape may have multiple holes, like 'B'.

### Tuning A, lining up holes

The hole commands must line up with the shape commands and, AFAIK, this must be done manually.&nbsp;
Fonts do not seem to need to do this at all.&nbsp;
They might list the holes in any order and they may come before or after the shapes.&nbsp;
I seriously spend some time eyeballing shapes and holes and then organize them for correct results.

### Tuning B, rotation

Fonts may specify a Shape clockwise or counter-clockwise.&nbsp;
They may specify a Hole clockwise or counter-clockwise.&nbsp;
Any given font might pick any pair of directions.&nbsp;
Luckily, they seem to stick with it through all the symbols.

My experience is the Babylon is only happy with one direction; I forget which.&nbsp;
So, the output of the Glyph Inspector might need reversal for Babylon.&nbsp;
I put some font-level flags in place to handle this.&nbsp;
You will find them at the top of each font file.&nbsp; 
My scientific method is to try all combinations until I find the one that looks good.

	Declarations for each current font
	(helvetica neue) { reverseHoles : false , reverseShapes : true  };
	(comic)          { reverseHoles : false , reverseShapes : true  };
	(jura)           { reverseHoles : true  , reverseShapes : false };


## 'C' is for Cat

So let's start with a simple letter, C.&nbsp;
Because we believe life should be easy, we will use 'HelveticaNeue-Medium.ttf'.&nbsp;
(This is a modern font and its files are pretty well-behaved.)&nbsp;
Visit https://opentype.js.org/glyph-inspector.html, upload the font file, and then click on the letter C.&nbsp;
What you see should be similar to the screen capture immediately below.&nbsp;

Note that the information we need is immediately visible.&nbsp;
The key thing is to get that information into MeshWriter in a form it can take.&nbsp;
